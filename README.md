Jarvis Voice Assistant (Python)

Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant capable of recognizing voice commands, opening websites, playing music, fetching news, and generating responses using Google Gemini AI.
It uses SpeechRecognition, gTTS, pygame, and google-generativeai for powerful voice interaction.

- Project Structure
project/
<br><br/>
│── main.py
<br><br/>
│── musicLibrary.py
<br><br/>
│── README.md


musicLibrary.py should contain something like:

music = {
    "song name": "youtube_link",
    ...
}

- Installation
1. Install Dependencies

Run:

pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pygame gtts requests google-generativeai pyaudio


Note:

On some systems, installing pyaudio may require additional setup.

- Configuration
1. Add your Gemini API key

Replace:

GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

2. Add your NewsAPI key

Set:

newsapi = "<Your NewsAPI Key>"


You can get one from: https://newsapi.org/

- How to Run

Run the script:

python main.py


Jarvis will start and say:

Initializing Jarvis...

- How to Use

The assistant listens continuously.

Say "Jarvis"

Speak your command. Examples:

Website commands

“Open Google”

“Open YouTube”

“Open LinkedIn”

- Music

“Play perfect”

“Play shape of you”

- News

“Tell me the news”

- AI Query

Anything else you say is processed via Gemini AI, for example:

“What is quantum computing?”

“Tell me a joke”

“Explain black holes”

-  How AI Response Works

Jarvis sends your message to Google Gemini:

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.0-flash")
resp = model.generate_content(command)


Returned text is spoken back using the custom speak() function.

- TTS System

The project uses:

gTTS → generates speech audio

pygame → plays the audio reliably

Auto-cleanup removes temporary audio files

 Notes & Troubleshooting
1. Microphone Issues?

Check if your system recognizes the microphone:

python -m speech_recognition

2. PyAudio Installation Error

On Windows, install:

pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio

3. Audio playback errors

Make sure your system audio output device is working.
